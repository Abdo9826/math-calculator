        Math has a certain logic to it. If you use it to accurately describe a
        situation, sometimes you can predict the inevitable — for instance, the
        moment an eclipse will take place — centuries in advance. To those
        unfamiliar with the math behind the prediction, this outcome might seem
        like magic. Indeed, the science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke famously
        wrote, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from
        magic.” In today’s Insights puzzle we’ll explore four examples of
        mathematical magic that can seem, at first glance, like mind reading.
        Just like stage magic, these examples can leave you wondering, “How did
        they know that?” Many of us have experienced this as children. We are
        asked by a friend to think of a certain number without revealing it. We
        are then asked to do a series of simple arithmetical operations on it.
        Finally, our friend astonishes us by telling us our secret number. So
        how is this done? Here’s a simple example that might astonish a child in
        your life and even inspire a fascination with math. It was used for this
        purpose by Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice’s Adventures in
        Wonderland. Carroll was an Oxford mathematician and avid puzzler, whose
        math puzzles have entertained many mathematicians, including the famous
        Terence Tao.
